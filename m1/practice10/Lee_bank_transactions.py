######### Learning Signature #########
Programmed by: Aaron Jared Lee
Date Submitted: September 13, 2026

Program Description: This program records each deposit and withdrawal to transactions.txt with a timestamp, account details, and balance after, and provides a function to read them back.

Reflection: I learned how to structure multi-line text records and parse them back into a list of dictionaries.
